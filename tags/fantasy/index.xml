      <description>&lt;p&gt;Each month the French photography magazine &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.chassimages.com&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Chasseur d&amp;rsquo;Images&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; proposes a theme for readers to send in photos and I often try and come up with ideas to submit. This month’s theme was fairy tales, and this captured my imagination as I&amp;rsquo;m interested in fantasy fiction and enjoy taking photos of models dressed up. However, with the deadline approaching and the Covid restrictions in place, I started to wonder how I could find a suitable model, costume, and makeup. Then I thought about the “Cottingley Fairies” phenomenon and decided to try and recreate one of these photos. Although the photo wasn&amp;rsquo;t chosen, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d show the results here, as I&amp;rsquo;m pleased with how the photo turned out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
