      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I was invited to a fancy dress party with a pirate theme. I had most of the things I needed for my costume but needed a few feathers and beads for that Johnny Depp look. Fortunately, not far from where I live, is a shop called “Festival Sensations”. The shop has the subtitle “Le plus grand magasin de fete de votre region” / “The largest party shop in your region”, which reminded me of the episode of Father Ted where the priests accidentally wander into “Ireland’s largest lingerie department”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
